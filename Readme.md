# Airflow Data Pipeline for PostgreSQL to AWS S3
This repository contains a Dockerized Airflow setup to orchestrate a data pipeline from an on-premise PostgreSQL database to AWS S3. It demonstrates how to use Airflow to automate the process of extracting data from a database, processing it, and loading it into an S3 bucket for further use.

# Project Components
Docker Compose: Manages the creation of Airflow, PostgreSQL, Redis, and PgAdmin services.
Airflow DAGs: Defines the sequence of tasks for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
Python Operators: Executes Python functions for ETL tasks.
AWS S3 Hook: Connects to AWS S3 to upload the processed data.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
Access to an AWS account and an S3 bucket.
PostgreSQL database with access to the required data.
Configuration
Clone this repository to your local machine.

# Create a .env file in the root directory with your configuration settings. Example variables include:

env
Copy code
AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME=apache/airflow:2.8.1
AIRFLOW_UID=50000
POSTGRES_USER=airflow
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=airflow
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=root
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
S3_CONN_ID=your_s3_connection_id
Adjust the docker-compose.yml and DAG scripts as needed to match your environment and workflow requirements.

#Running the Project
Build and start the services with Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build -d
Access the Airflow web UI by navigating to http://localhost:8080. Use the credentials defined in your .env file to log in.

Configure Airflow connections for PostgreSQL and AWS S3 through the web UI under Admin > Connections.

Enable and trigger the DAG from the Airflow web UI to start the data pipeline.

# Customization
Modify the provided DAG (postgres_to_s3_dag.py) to include any specific data transformations or additional steps required for your use case.
Update the Docker Compose and environment configuration files as necessary to accommodate different versions or additional services.
Security
Ensure that sensitive information such as database credentials and AWS access keys are securely managed. Do not hard-code credentials in your DAGs or Docker configuration files.
Use Airflow's built-in mechanisms for handling secrets, such as environment variables or the Secret Backend feature.
